Writing blogs has been something of quite interest for me with my areas on interest varying from life and philosophy to my travel experiences to tech stuff. However it is impractical that I can have a blog for everything. So I narrowed down to two blogs - one for tech stuff and one for random stuff.

I am not a professional content writer and therefore I know there is a lot that I could improve. I would be honoured if you could take out the time to checkout my blogs and give me your valuable feedback through comments or any of the contact details I have shared in this site.
